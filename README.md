Using python in a robust MTV (Model, Template, View) Framework

In this section we covered how python can be used to create full-scale web applications with the help of the Django.

Main concepts were:

 - What is an MVC framework?
 - What benefits would we gain by using an MVC or MTV framework?
 - Redirect to other routes
 - Render specific templates
 - Invoke methods attached to other pieces of our app that we characterize as models
 - Build database tables
 - Handle logic related to database operations, including validation
