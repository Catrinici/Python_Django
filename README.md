# Coding Dojo Python (Django)
### Using python in a robust MTV (Model, Template, View) Framework

#### In this section we covered how python can be used to create full-scale web applications with the help of the Django.
#### Main concepts were:
* ##### What is an MVC framework?
* ##### What benefits would we gain by using an MVC or MTV framework?
* ##### Redirect to other routes
* ##### Render specific templates
* ##### Invoke methods attached to other pieces of our app that we characterize as models
* ##### Build database tables
* ##### Handle logic related to database operations, including validation

# Projects

* ##### Django App
  >- Familiarity with setting up a new Django project
  >- Familiarity with setting up a new Django app
  >- Familiarity with routing
  >- Familiarity with views and how to render a simple Http Response

* ##### Time Display
  > Create a Django app called time_display where the current time and date displays on localhost:3000
  >- Practice setting up a Django project
  >- Familiarity with passing data to a template
  
* ##### Random Word Generator
  > Create a new Django app called 'random_word'. Your template will show a random word with 14 characters in length.  
  > The first time you use this app, it should say 'attempt #1'. Each time you generate a new random keyword, it should increment the attempt figure. The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce your use of session

  >- Familiarity with passing data to a template
  >- Familiarity with using Django session 
  
  * ##### Survey Form
  > Build a Django application that accepts a form submission and presents the submitted data on a results page
  > Do NOT have a single URL handle BOTH the POST submission as well as the rendering of the html. In other words, never render on a post.  
  
  >- Start Django app from scratch
  >- Reinforce the important concepts you want to master
  >- Get you to build things a lot faster as each iteration will help you optimize your workflow
